# Sonic, jump!
## SDL Mini Project

### For Linux users:

To play the game, run:
```
$ make
```

Then, you'll find the executable game in _bin_ folder. Therefore, you could instead run:
```
$ make install
$ cd bin
$ ./'Sonic, jump!'
```

Remember you must have SDL installed:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev
```
